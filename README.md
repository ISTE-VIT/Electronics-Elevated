A comprehensive, hands-on workshop wherein the participants will learn to create a low-cost automatic sanitizer dispenser from scratch. The project "Automatic Sanitizer Dispenser" has potential to be a contactless solution to poor sanitation in public areas. Using a beginner-friendly approach, it will be implemented on a simulation software using arduino and IR sensor followed by a simulation of a pure electronics based implementation. The approaches will be compared based on factors such as quality and cost, ultimately finding the most suitable approach in the scenario.
